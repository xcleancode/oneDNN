This C++ API example demonstrates how to create and execute a :ref:`Logsoftmax <doxid-dev_guide_logsoftmax>` primitive in forward training propagation mode.

This C++ API example demonstrates how to create and execute a :ref:`Logsoftmax <doxid-dev_guide_logsoftmax>` primitive in forward training propagation mode.

Key optimizations included in this example:

* In-place primitive execution;

* Softmax along axis 1 (C) for 2D tensors.
